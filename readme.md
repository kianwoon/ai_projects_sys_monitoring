Below is an outline of how you might approach building such an application, along with practical tips and sample code outlines. The overall architecture involves:

Capturing the Dashboard Image:Use your computer’s camera to capture an image of the Grafana dashboard. OpenCV is a popular library for this task.Image Processing & Color Analysis:Process the captured image to locate the dashboard sections that display the services. You can use techniques such as region-of-interest (ROI) extraction (possibly manually defined if the layout is fixed) and color space conversion (to HSV, for example) to differentiate colors.Green indicates that the service is OK.Red indicates that the service is down.Service Identification via OCR:To associate the detected color areas with service names, you can perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Tesseract (via pytesseract in Python) is a widely used OCR tool that can extract text from the designated regions in the image.Alerting via Email:When a service is detected as down (red), gather the service name and any additional information you deem necessary and send an email to the support team. Python’s built-in smtplib can be used for sending emails, or you can leverage external email APIs for better reliability and ease.Scheduling Repeated Checks:To have the process run every minute, consider using a scheduling library (such as Python’s schedule) or simply run an infinite loop with a time.sleep(60) delay. This loop should include error handling to ensure the application remains robust for 24x7 operation.
